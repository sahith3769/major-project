# **App Name**: SkinVision AI

## Core Features:

- Image Upload and Display: Allow users to upload skin images for analysis and display the uploaded image.
- Disease Prediction: Use a pre-trained deep learning model (CNN, VGG16, ResNet50) to predict the likelihood of various skin diseases from the uploaded image.
- Result Display: Display the predicted disease and confidence level in an understandable format. Include a disclaimer that the result is not a substitute for professional medical advice.
- Model Selection: Implement the 3 deep learning models which were previously trained outside the app: CNN, VGG16, and ResNet50.
- Image Preprocessing: Preprocess uploaded images to ensure compatibility with the deep learning models. Resize, normalize and remove noise from images for increased AI tool accuracy.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#B0E2FF) to convey trust and medical association.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E6F7FF), almost white, for a clean, clinical feel.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for key actions and important information to guide the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for clean readability.
- Use clean, simple icons to represent different functions and information. Use the 'Font Awesome' icon library, or similar, in the solid style, using teal for primary icons and the primary color for accents.
- A clean, single-page layout to simplify the user experience.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement when predictions are being made, to signal that the AI tool is working.
